  <summary>class-2: HTTP && Express</summary>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>HTTP Server</summary>
          <ul>
           <li>HTTP is one of many protocols that are useful to transfer some type of data. In this case HTTP means HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This is the most used on internet to transfer data, specially web pages. Examples: 
           <ul>
             <li>A user have some device (a phone) and wants to reach some content. In order to reach it the user should make a request. The request have a: 
             <ul>
               <li>
                 url (where are you making the request)
               </li>
               <li>
                 headers (aditional information about the request like tokens, type of data we are especting to receive, we can send the cookies). Those are optional
               </li>
               <li>
                 the method (the type fo request: GET â€”to requestâ€” or POST â€”to sendâ€” or others)
               </li>
               <li>
                 and sometimes we send a body (data we want to send)
               </li>
             </ul>
             </li>
             <li>
               The request reach a Server. The server will process it the request with everything sent from the user (it will go to a database, treath the data). That process will take some time (unknow time) and when this finish it will send a response to the user.
             </li>
             <li>The request and the response have different data and this is critical to understand how all of this work. Every part have to send different data</li>
             <li>The data that the response have is:
               <ul>
                 <li>statusCode (200, 404, 500, etc)</li>
                 <li>body of the response: this are actually the data that you asked</li>
                 <li>headers</li>
               </ul>
             </li>
             <li>After receiving the data, the conextion should be closed unleass some header will say that it should keep open</li>
            </ul>
           </li>
           <li>Caveats ðŸŸ¨:
             <ul>
               <li>With the statusCode: in reality this is in the header but is important this to be alone because when the headers is writen first the statusCode is writen and after that the headers</li>
               <li>The HTTP protocol historically had so many security problems and therefore exist the HTTPS protocol. This can be used on localhost but is too complicated and it require a certification. Right now we are going to focus on the HTTP and the API. Another problem is having a service on HTTP on localhost that works correctly but when you deploy it you wrapp that in a service that use HTTPS, therefore interanally is HTTP but is wrapped in HTTPS so everything is encrypted and it doesn't have any problems</li>
               </ul>
             </li>
             <li>
               Status code:
               <ul>
                 <li>
                   From 100 to 199: Informational
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   From 200 to 299: Success
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   From 300 to 399: Redirection
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   From 400 to 499: Client error. The client tried: enter to a page that doesn't exist; send data in a wrong format; it doesn't have permission to access to something
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   From 500 to 599: Server error
                 </li>

                   301: Moved permanently. The resource of this direction was moved to 
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   400: Bad request
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   404: Not found
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   500: Internal server error. This is a tricky one because you will not know exactly what happened
                 </li>

             <li>
               Buffer data on the file <code>class-2/1.http.js</code>:
               <ul>
                 <li>
                   The "data" second argument here is a Buffer. A Buffer is a global class in nodejs that is useful to work with binary data: a when a .txt file or an image is received by nodejs is readed they binary data and is stored, temporary, in some place of the physical memory to work with them.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   Before the read of the data nodejs doesn't know what it is: an image, a text or other, is just a binary data. The nodejs know that is an image when reach the "else" where the header is set to "Content-Type: image/<code>extension</code>". Here the codification magic happen: the browser know is an image because the Content-Type setted. 
                 </li>
                 <li>The buffers are useful to work with files, images, criptography and anything that is not plain text or jsons. Those are critical when you want to work with data transmision because how to file are readed or to received through the network</li>
               </ul>

        <summary>Routing</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>In commonJS you can import json data directly and use it</li>
          <li>Methods of routing:
            <ul>
              <li>GET: To get data</li>
              <li>HEAD: Is exactly the same as get but without the responding of the body. Is usually used to know if the user have permission to access to some content</li>
              <li>POST: To create data</li>
              <li>PUT: To update data, this replace the content</li>
              <li>PATCH: To modifiy partially some data</li>
              <li>DELETE: To delete data</li>
              <li>OPTIONS: This is used to know which communication are available for the target resource. This is usually the problem we have on CORS on browser. The browser make a request to a server and this server send a response with the type of comunication allowed. The OPTION return the headers CORS</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Caveats ðŸŸ¨:
            <ul>
              <li>There's some discusiÃ³n about the use of POST versus PATCH. Search it</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>In this class the file api.http was used</li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <li>
        <details>
          <summary>Express</summary>
          <ul>
            <li>When you use express it add some header call X-Powered-By with the value of "Express". This could lead to security problems because everyone can know te technology you are using and try to exploit vulnerabilities there. is recommended to disable this with Â«app.disable("x-powered-by")Â»</li>
            <li>One of the magic thing of express is the use of middleware. This can be used to extract cookies, validate if the user is logged, extract the data from json or any type of logic. Is something previous to to do before it arraive to the request. When it's done it call the Â«next()Â» method to continue. The middleware is executed between the request and the response</li>
            <li>
              Middleware: 
              <ul>
                <li>You can decide to which request the middleware will affect. For example:
                <ul>
                  <li>app.use("/pokemon/*", fn) â†’ All the requests that start with "/pokemon/*" will be affected</li>
                <li>app.use("/", fn) â†’ Only the request on home will be affected</li>
                <li>app.use(fn) â†’ All the routes will be affected. This is the usual behavior</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>The middleware can be used also for specific methods: only for GET, only for POST</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Caveats ðŸŸ¨:
                  <ul>
                    <li>You shouldn't forget the final Â«next()Â» method because if you forget it will wait infinitely for the next request</li>
                    <li>A middleware can be used at first, in between or at last. The concept of this is "be in the middle" but technically the Â«app.use()Â» can be used as a middleware anywhere. Is like a proxy, intercep the request to respond it later. A proxy and a middleware intercep a request but the final goal is different: the Proxy will have the responsibility of orchestration but the Middleware will do that and apply some logic or task into it. A Middleware could reject a request</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>On Express the method <code>app.use(express.json())</code> ccan be used to make something a json. See the file <code>class-2/3.express.js</code> on line <code>33</code> to learn it</li>
            <li>Express allow you to use the route first and the callback after</li>
            <li>In the post, everything is the same as nodejs</li>
            <li>The calls of <code>app.*</code> is dependendat on the order</li>
            <li>The API <code>app.liste</code> is the same as nodejs</li>

    <details>
      <summary>API REST</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>
          REST mean: Representational State Transfer an Software Architecture (not a framework, not a library, not an idea, not a pattern)
        </li>
        <li>
          Was created to transfer data specially on web
        </li>
        <li>
          Was created on the 2000 year by Roy Fielding
        </li>
        <li>
          Principals features on REST:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Scalability
            </li>  
            <li>
              Simplicity
            </li>  
            <li>
              Visibility
            </li>  
            <li>
              Portability
            </li>  
            <li>
              Realiability
            </li>  
            <li>
              Easy to modify
            </li>  
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          All Software Architecture should achieve a goal with some principals that can sustain over time the best possible way and simplify the creation of that piece of software. This is the goal of every Software Architecture
        </li>
        <li>
          Fundamentals on REST:
          <ul>
            <li>Resources: everything here is a resource (a user, book, some publication, an image or a collection of this resources, a list of users, books, and so on). Every resource will be identified with an URL</li>
            <li>Methods: what kind of action you want to do with the resource. This could be GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, CONNECT and TRACE. The most common actions made here are the "CRUD" â†’ Create (POST), Read (GET), Update (PUT or PATCH), Delete (DELETE)</li>
            <li>Representation: This is how the resource is represented: the most common representation is JSON but is not mandatory, this could be also XML, HTML, CSV, etc. The client decide which representation be the resource, having none restriction on the format. One client can ask for a JSON while other client can ask for a XML representation</li>
            <li>Stateless: every request to the server should contain all the neccesary data to understand that request. This mean the server should not be able to remember anything about the request. For example it cannot save how many calls have been made to the server, it have to make pagination or not, that data should be always on the URL of the request. Sometimes some data can be save to help the client but in that case the REST architecture will be break. Another case is when we have some database on the backend.</li>
            <li>Unified interfaz: this is difficul to break it but it means that the interfaz between client and server should be consistent for every interaction. The URLs should always do the same, should always be called the same</li>
            <li>Separation of concepts: components of client and server should be separated. This allow the server and the client evolve independently</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Caveat ðŸŸ¨:
          <ul>
            <li>Sometimes you can make some API that is not REST, another architecture exist (like SOAP or GraphQL). Some people think that an API that return a JSON is immediately a REST API but it is not always the case</li>
            <li>Resources: sometimes you can decide to identify the resources with a path on the URL or with some queries. It will depend on the specific use case you want to achieve</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Express use path-to-regex</summary>
        <ol>
          <li>Is possible to put regex in the URL but express use this library: path-to-regex, like this <code>app.get("/movies/:id", fn)</code>
          </li>
          <li>Is possible to use <code>/movies/:id/:couldBeMore/*:andAsMuchAsYouWant</code> where the <code>:id</code>, <code>:couldBeMore</code>, <code>:andAsMuchAsYouWant</code> and <code>*</code> are part of the URL separated by an slash. Is your decition using it this way or making them query params</li>
          <li>Everytime you can, use path-to-regex because make the regex by you can lead into problems</li>
          <li>To know more check the github repository of <a href="https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp">pillarjs</a> or the <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html">express explanation in their documentation</a>r></li>

          <summary>POST, PATCH, PUT and Schema (Zod)</summary>
          <ul>
            <li>To Understand the POST: You have to work all the time in the same route, is not like you can put here `app.post("/create-movies", fn)`, this is because the Resource is defined by the URL and is the verb which decide what's going to be done there: GET, POST, other</li>
            <li>ID on Post: <code>crypto.randomUUID()</code></li>
            <li>With Zod: You can validate the data with the method "parse" or you can use "safeParse". With "safeParse" you will have a object result with data or errors. You can even use the safeParseAsync to avoid blocking the request return movieSchema.parse(objectToValidate)</li>
            <li>On the error of the validation of schema (Zod):
              <ul>You can pass here a 422 instead a 400:
                <li>
                  The 400 status code is because the client did something to lead on this error: sintaxis error, the data sent was not correct. The important thing here is: the client cannot do a new request without modifications
                </li>
                <li>Other approach is 422: the server understood the request, type of content but the sintaxis of the resource was not possible to created because some validation or instruction was not correct. The same as the previous: client will not be able to make another request is it not change something </li>
                <li>Final though, use anything you want  </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Remember, a REST API don't save data by their own. For that, use a database </li>
            <li>Idempotence and differences between POST, PUT and PATCH:
              <ul>
                <li>Idempotence: is the property of realize an action several times and even though achieve the same result as you would  get with the first try. Pure functions are idempotent. This property talk about the inner state of something. Now the methods</li>
                <li>Purpose of POST: create a new element/resource on server
                  <ol>
                    <li>On URL: `/movies`</li>
                    <li>Idempotence: this is not idempotente because every time you call this method a new resource is created</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Purpose of PUT: update an existing element/resource on server o create it if it doesn't exist
                  <ol>
                    <li>On URL: `/movies/:id` â†’ `/movies/123-456-789`</li>
                    <li>Idempotence: this is idempotente the bast majority of the time, but it could not be sometimes</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Purpose of PATCH: update partially an existing element/resource on server
                  <ol>
                    <li>On URL: `/movies/:id` â†’ `/movies/123-456-789`</li>
                    <li>Idempotence: this is not idempotente ithe bast majority of the time, but it could be sometimes</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>One question, is it danger to create the ID from outside? The answer: it could be but this will depend of the context of the application. For example, sometimes this ID can come from outside: the email of an user for example or other thing that will identify that person as unique in the analog world</li>

            <summary>CORS: Cross Origin Resource Sharing</summary>
            <ul>
              <li>This only works on browsers not in servers. The CORS is a mechanism that restrict if a resource can be used on some origin. The browsers make the request to this resource. Here the browser on origin <code>http://localhost:8080/</code> aka <code>mywebsite.com</code> ask to <code>http://localhost:3000</code> aka <code>API.com</code> <i>Is true that <strong>mywebsite.com</strong> who is not you (of course the browser ask in this situation, if would not, it would not ask) is able to get resources from <strong>API.com</strong>?</i></li>
              <li>When this is not possible the way from the API to say <strong>no</strong> is with the <strong>lack of headers</strong></li>
              <li>This problem can only be solved in the backend: on the API, on proxy, in the router or on anything that can add the required header. Who should add that header? For now that's not important</li>
              <li>The way to to solve this in express is adding this to the routes you want to enable <code>res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:8080")</code>. In this case <code>http://localhost:8080</code> would be <i><strong>mywebsite.com</strong></i></li>
              <li>You can also replace the specific <code>http</code> site for this <code>*</code>, to enable all the request for anyone</li>
              <li>Here is very possible that you don't know would be the origin, it would be <code>3000</code>, <code>8080</code>, <code>4500</code>, <code>1234</code>? So, the solution for this could be:
                <ul>
                  <li>Detect the origin and decide what to do. For example, you can have a list of <code>ACCEPTED_ORIGINS</code></li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  A caveat here ðŸŸ¨: the <code>origin</code> header is not always sent by the browser. This is not send by the browser when the request is from the same origin. This mean, if I'm in the <code>http:localhost:3000</code> and I make a request to <code>http:localhost:3000</code> no <code>origin</code> header will sent
                </li>
                <li>Exist simples and complex methods with CORS:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Simples: <code>GET</code>, <code>HEAD</code> and <code>POST</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>Complex: <code>PUT</code>, <code>PATCH</code> and <code>DELETE</code>
                      <ul>
                        <li>This methods have something call <code>Preflight</code>, this mean that you need to add a call with the method <code>OPTIONS</code> in order to make them acceptable</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  At the end the problem with <code>CORS</code> is a problem of headers. You should be able to use <code>res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", origin)</code> and <code>res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE")</code> to solve it in the correct place: in the middleware and/or where the request is made
                </li>
                <li>Is it possible to solve this using express or you can use a third party library call <code>cors</code>. Check the <code>app.js</code> file to check how to use it. One caveat ðŸŸ¨ with that solution: it will solve adding an <code>*</code> to everything. In order to make that library behave as the native approach you have to pass it some options</li>

        <summary>ESModules</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>In order to use the ESModules instead the commonJS approach, you can go into your package.json and add this <code>"type": "module"</code>. With that you will be able to use the ESModules without change the extension of the files. But at the same time, you will not be able to use the commonJS approach without change the extension of the file</li>
          <li>When you import some module is a good practice put the extention, like this <code>import { QUERY_KEYS, moviesQueryParams } from "./utils/moviesQueryParams.js"</code>. As developer we are bas used to not put the extension at the end, because we are lazy, because TypeScript, because builders</li>
          <li>On ESModules import json is not allow directly <code>import allMoviesJSON from "./data/movies.json"</code> you can do it with different approaches:
            <ul>
              <li><code>import allMoviesJSON from "./data/movies.json" assert { type: "json" }</code> â†’ This is not recommended because the <code>assert</code> will stop work at some point</li>
              <li><code>import allMoviesJSON from "./data/movies.json" with { type: "json" }</code> â†’ Change the <code>assert</code> for <code>with</code> </li>
              <li>
                <ol>
                  <li><code>import fs from "node:fs"</code></li>
                  <li><code>const allMoviesJSON = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("./data/movies.json", "utf-8"))</code></li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                Recommended (until the import of JSON will be native on ESModules): create a require (this is more performante)
                <ol>
                  <li><code>import { createRequire } from "node:module"</code></li>
                  <li><code>const require = createRequire(import.meta.url)</code></li>
                  <li><code>const allMoviesJSON = require("./data/movies.json")</code></li>

        <summary>MVC: Model, View, Controller</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Exist some debate if the MVC is a <code>Design Pattern</code> or a <code>Architecture Patterns</code>. It seems more like an architecture. Nonetheless, it doesn't explain everything because it doesn't tell you how to implement the <code>View</code></li>
          <li>This is highly used on web and mobile applications but other frameworks also work like this, like <code>ruby on rails</code>, <code>Django</code>, <code>ASP.net</code> and others</li>
          <li>
            This architecture forces you to separate the application in three main component that work togheter, the Mode, the View and the Controller
          </li>
          <li>
            Exist several iteration of this architecture. But the one we going to see here is the most classic one
          </li>
          <li><code>Model:</code>
           <ul>
            <li>This is the logic of the business, the data structure, inner rules of the business</li>
            <li>
              This is in charge of access the database, update the data, check if the integrity of the data are correct (for example, if you try to create and ID, that ID shouldn't exist)
            </li>
           </ul>
          </li>
          <li><code>View:</code>
           <ul>
            <li>This is the most important part for the user: with this the user will interact because the user cannot interact with the Model neither the Controller</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><code>Controller:</code>
           <ul>
              <li>This is an intermediary between the Model and the View, this respond to the entries of the user every time they make on. This part of the application is responsable for know what to do with the model. Is like an Orchestrator</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
              This three parts should work togheter. First the controller will ask for data to the <code>Model</code>, the model will return the data to the <code>Controller</code> and after that it will init the <code>View</code>. After that the user throught the <code>View</code> will interact wanting something happen. With that interact of the user the <code>Controller</code> will act asking for the correct data to the <code>Model</code>, generally speaking having the <code>CRUD</code> approach here with them
          </li>
          <li>
            Remember here, from the <code>View</code> is not possible to interact directly with the <code>Model</code>. But is possible indirectly because the user, at the end, make some request to the <code>Model</code> through the <code>Controller</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            The advantage of this is the separation of the responsabilities on the application, specially the Logic of the Business (<code>Model</code>), because this is the most important thing on the application when it have to connect to a database. This will help to scalability and test, to name some
          </li>
          <li>Examples:
            <ul>
              <li><code>View</code>:
                <ul>
                  <li><code>React</code></li>
                  <li><code>Vue</code></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><code>Controller</code>:
                <ul>
                  <li><code>Express</code></li>
                  <li><code>DJango</code></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><code>Model</code>:
                <ul>
                  <li><code>mySQL</code></li>
                  <li><code>mongoDB</code></li>
                  <li>Local</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The goal is have black boxes that interact with each other. Each one should know how to interact with the other but it doesn't whould know how them interanally make their things. This is the key of architecture and clean code: separation of by layers, separation of concepts
          </li>
          <li>
            In the code is not neccesary that the <code>Model</code> and the <code>Controll</code> share the same names for the methods. Even sometimes you will need to call more than one <code>Model</code> from the <code>Controller</code>
          </li>
          <li>Validations:
            <ul>
              <li>This happend along all the aplication: <code>Model</code>, <code>View</code>, <code>Controller</code> but is made in different ways depending on the category</li>
              <li><code>Controller</code>: usually here the validation is of format and coherence of the data received, to be possible to be procesed before send it to the <code>Model</code>. When it comes from the input from the user, is a good thing to validate the data before to send it to the <code>Model</code>. With this validation you allow the data is correct to be used or to avoid attacks</li>
              <li><code>Model</code>: usually the validation here are for the business rules, data coherence, data persistant in the database and others like check the ID</li>
              <li>The <code>View</code> is the most useless for the business logic but is the most important in terms of user experience</li>
              <li>Is debatable if the <code>Model</code> can have some method that say which field allow and with wich type, like a integer, a string and so son. That method can be exported into the <code>Controller</code> to make the validation there. Here the validation will stay apply in the <code>Model</code> but it will be used, also, by the <code>Controller</code> </li>
              <li>With this said: validation on <code>Model</code> and <code>Controller</code> are mandatory, validations on <code>View</code> are optional (very interesting)</li>
            </ul>

        <summary>Difference between <code>Design Pattern</code> and <code>Architecture Pattern</code></summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The <code>Design Pattern</code>: is an easy, repeteable, to solve something specific in a part of the code. For example:
            <ol>
              <li>Pattern Observer</li>
              <li>Pattern Factory</li>
              <li>Pattern Modules</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>The <code>Architecture Pattern</code> has to do with all your application: how to implement everything</li>
          <li>The architecture on software development make sense when you work on business with products or services. In order to be a Software Engineering, you need to create products that scale, be maintainable and work</li>
