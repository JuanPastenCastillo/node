/* 
In this class a REST will be created. 
  - REST mean: Representational State Transfer an Software Architecture (not a framework, not a library, not an idea, not a pattern). 
  - Was created to transfer data specially on web.
  - Was created on the 2000 year by Roy Fielding 

Principals features on REST:
  - Scalability
  - Simplicity
  - Visibility
  - Portability
  - Realiability 
  - Easy to modify

All Software Architecture should achieve a goal with some principals that can sustain over time the best possible way and simplify the creation of that piece of software. This is the goal of every Software Architecture

Fundamentals on REST:
  - Resources: everything here is a resource (a user, book, some publication, an image or a collection of this resources, a list of users, books, and so on). Every resource will be identified with an URL
  - Methods: what kind of action you want to do with the resource. This could be a GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, CONNECT, or TRACE. The most common actions made here are the "CRUD" â†’ Create (POST), Read (GET), Update (PUT or PATCH), Delete (DELETE)
  - Representation: This is how the resource is represented: the most common representation is JSON but is not mandatory, this could be also XML, HTML, CSV, etc. The client decide which representation be the resource, having none restriction on the format. One client can ask for a JSON while other client can ask for a XML representation
  - Stateless: every request to the server should contain all the neccesary data to understand that request. This mean the server should not be able to remember anything about the request. For example it cannot save how many calls have been made to the server, it have to make pagination or not, that data should be always on the URL of the request. Sometimes some data can be save to help the client but in that case the REST architecture will be break. Another case is when we have some database on the backend.
  - Unified interfaz: this is difficul to break it but it means that the interfaz between client and server should be consistent for every interaction. The URLs should always do the same, should always be called the same
  - Separation of concepts: components of client and server should be separated. This allow the server and the client evolve independently

Caveat ðŸŸ¨:
  - Sometimes you can make some API that is not REST, another architecture exist (like SOAP or GraphQL
  ). Some people think that an API that return a JSON is immediately a REST API but it is not always the case.

/* 
This is important: the Idempotence. Is the property of realize an action several times and even though achieve the same result as you would  get with the first try. Pure functions are idempotent. This property talk about the inner state of something. Now the methods:

- Purpose of POST: create a new element/resource on server
  + On URL: `/movies`
  + Idempotence: this is not idempotente because every time you call this method a new resource is created
- Purpose of PUT: update an existing element/resource on server o create it if it doesn't exist
  + On URL: `/movies/:id` â†’ `/movies/123-456-789`
  + Idempotence: this is idempotente the bast majority of the time, but it could not be sometimes
- Purpose of PATCH: update partially an existing element/resource on server
  + On URL: `/movies/:id` â†’ `/movies/123-456-789`
  + Idempotence: this is not idempotente ithe bast majority of the time, but it could be sometimes
  
One question, is it danger to create the ID from outside? The answer: it could be but this will depend of the context of the application. For example, sometimes this ID can come from outside: the email of an user for example or other thing that will identify that person as unique in the analog world
